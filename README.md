# Bashscripting
 In this repo you can find the scripts and methodology to learn bash / shell scripting

# Git Commands I have used

git clone url (will clone or download the whole repo)
git add . / file (git will start tracking the changes and moves the file to staging area)
git commit -m "Msg" (commiting the changes to local repository)
git push (pushes the changes to remote repository or GitHub)
git pull (pull the changes from repository since the last clone)

 I have cloned the repository and have added few changes that I would like to pust the changes back to GitHub Repo

# Here is the flow to follow :
1. Clone the repo using "git clone"
2. open the repo in VS code / Editor, do the changes
3. git add . ; git commit -m "Messgae telling what have you done" ; git push
4. Changes that you have made are pushed
5. On your server, do a "git clone url" for the first time and from second time to test, just do a "git pull"
